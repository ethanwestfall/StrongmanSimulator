      <h2>Overall Philosophy</h2>
      <p><span>Definition of "Peak":</span> The point(s) in time in an athlete's career when he performed 
        his very best (i.e., won or placed well on events) at major competition(s).</p>
      <p><span>Comparing Athletes:</span> Must be done on an event-by-event basis so that athletes perform 
        better in competitions with events that suit their strengths. Some inconsistency is built in so that 
        athletes perform at their best 5/8 of the time, at a level below their best 2/8 of the time, and at two 
        levels below their best 1/8 of the time. This ensures, for example, that athletes who are really good 
        at an event will never lose to athletes who are mid-level at the same event, but they may lose to athletes 
        of a similar skill-level. Ties are broken by a randomly generated number.</p>
      <p><span>The Impact of Eras:</span> Key assumption -- Athletes who were dominant in one era against the 
      level of competition they faced would be similarly dominant in other eras. This may not be true for the 
      "average" strongman in an era, but it's likely more true for the best of the best.</p>

      <ol id="athlete-ratings-explanation">
        <li>
          <p>Major competitions won, as well as other international competitions won 
          (in the red box).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><span>Peak Rating:</span> Each athlete is given a score of between 1 and 10 points for each 
          event. This score directly correlates to the best the athlete has placed on 
          each event at a major competition; for example, a 1st place 
          max deadlift at the Arnold Strongman Classic would give the athlete 
          a 10-point max deadlift. In rare situations where an athlete has won the same event 
          three or more times at major competitions, 11 points is awarded.</p>
          <p>Events are then grouped into categories (e.g., "pulling"), with the average 
            of all events in the category representing the category score out of 10. See #4 below 
          for a visual representation of these category averages.</p>
          <p>The category averages are then combined to form a "Peak Rating" score. The Pulling, 
            Pressing, Stone Lifting, and Moving categories are each weighted twice as 
            heavily as the Squatting, Throwing, and Endurance categories.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><span>Career Rating:</span> Each athlete receives a career rating based on how many competitions they won or 
            did well at in their career. This metric could use some work, but, currently, points are awarded as follows:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>25 points for the 1st major competition win</li>
              <li>10 points for each additional major win thereafter</li>
              <li>5 points for each major competition 2nd place</li>
              <li>2 points for each major competition 3rd place</li>
              <li>0.2 points for each non-major international win</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><span>Skills:</span> Category averages, as explained in #2.</p>
        </li>
